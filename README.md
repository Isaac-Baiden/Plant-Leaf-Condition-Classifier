# Plant-Leaf-Condition-Classifier
This project uses a Vision Transformer (ViT) model to classify plant leaf conditions into various categories such as healthy leaves and diseased leaves. The model is trained on a variety of plant species and their common diseases. After classification, the app provides actionable mitigation strategies to help treat or manage the disease.
