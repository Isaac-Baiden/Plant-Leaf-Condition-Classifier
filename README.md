# Plant-Leaf-Condition-Classifier
This project uses a Vision Transformer (ViT) model to classify plant leaf conditions into various categories such as healthy leaves and diseased leaves. The model is trained on a variety of plant species and their common diseases. After classification, the app provides actionable mitigation strategies to help treat or manage the disease.

Project Notes
Technology Used: Streamlit for the app, TensorFlow for the model, and OpenCV for image processing.
Model Type: Vision Transformer (ViT) trained on a dataset of plant leaf images.
Key Features:
Classify plant leaf conditions.
Suggest mitigation or treatment strategies.
Ensure good image quality (sharpness, lighting, contrast) for accurate predictions.

â€¢	Main Function (main()):

o	Sets the page configuration and title.
o	Loads the model using load_keras_model().
o	Provides instructions for enabling camera access.
o	Handles image input from both file uploads and the camera.
o	Displays the uploaded image.
o	Performs image quality checks.
o	Predicts the class using the loaded model.
o	Displays the prediction, confidence, and mitigation strategy.
o	Saves the image and logs the prediction.
o	Includes a sidebar with project information.
o	Adds project overview to the main body.

I wish to further refine the entire project.
